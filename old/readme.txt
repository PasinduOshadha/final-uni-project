regression :

To create a regression model to predict the "y" value for the next 5 years, you would need to first prepare the data by cleaning and pre-processing it to remove missing values and outliers. After preparing the data, you would then split the data into a training set and a test set.

Next, you would choose a regression algorithm that is suitable for your data and problem. Common regression algorithms include linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression.

Once you have chosen your algorithm, you would train the model using the training data. This involves using the algorithm to learn the relationship between the input variables (such as the year, total cargo handled, total container traffic, etc.) and the output variable (the "y" value).

Finally, you would evaluate the performance of the model by using it to make predictions on the test data and comparing the predictions to the actual values. Based on the results, you may need to make adjustments to the model and repeat the process until you are satisfied with the performance.

Once the model is finalized, you can use it to make predictions for the next 5 years by inputting the relevant data for those years.
